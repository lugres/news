The Newspaper app is intended to hold news articles published by journalists, making it possible to leave comments to the articles by different app users.

Newspaper app was built with a powerful Python-based web framework, Django. It uses a custom user model with a standard but robust login, logout, and signup functiolaty, supporting user password reset via email. Proper user permissions and authorizations were implemented. Also Bootstrap framework was added to provide some CSS styling. App functionality is extensively covered by unit-tests. Articles and comments are stored in a PostgeSQL cluster.
